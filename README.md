## Setup
In order to use this simple project you have to install exifread dependency https://pypi.org/project/ExifRead/.

`pip install exifread`


## Usage
1. First you have to recover your files using TestDisk, I'm not going to teach you how to do that, there are a lot of tutorials.
2. If you recovered your files correctly you'll and up with a folder containing a lot of folders labeled 'recup_dir.N', this main folder will be your `SRC_PATH`.
3. Now you have to decide where you want your files to be sorted and copied, this will be your `OUT_PATH`.
4. You can now edit 'recover_jpg.py' and change those two variables at line 7 and 8, make sure to have `TAGS` set to empy: `TAGS = []`
Now you can run the application:

`python ./recover_jpg.py`

You'll soon notice that the program will pause anytime it will encounter a new DEVICE, if you want to keep all the photos made by that device, enter `Y`:

You can now continue this procedure, as soon as the program will end:

## Considerations
As you can see from the screenshots, the program will create a folder for the year, inside that a folder for the device and than it will copy all the photos renaming them '%Y:%m:%d %H:%M:%S.jpg'.

I tested it with more than 353GB of data, and more than 350000 files. It worked perfectly!
